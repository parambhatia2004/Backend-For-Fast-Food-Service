# BackendForFastFoodService
As part of an academic project, I developed a backend which utilised Java Generics & Interfaces to manage restaurant information, customer details, as well as favourite restaurants of each customer.
All data structures were programmed by me with the aim of handling large amounts of data in an efficient manner.
I recieved a First-Class grade (highest band available) for this project.
